Hello! I'm Madhavam, a Full-stack Software Developer based in Dallas, Texas.

I am pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science from Texas Christian University (Full Scholarship). I have over 3 years of experience with Software Development. I've designed and developed multiple android apps using Flutter and Firebase which have hundreds of active users. Having interned at multiple companies in the past as a software developer, I have hands-on experience with solving real-world problems.

Here is a snapshot of my experience!
