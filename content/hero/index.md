I'm a student at Texas Christian University (Full Scholarship) majoring in Computer Science. I'm experienced with java,python,Flutter,Dart,Javascript, Node.js, Firebase, React and more. I'm looking for internship opportunities in Software Development and growing my skill set.

I enjoy writing code to solve real-world problems!
